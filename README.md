Map app to log mobile signal strength

This is an app that I use NodeJs and MongoDB at server and React and React Mapbox at client.

There is a Google Login with a issue: At localhost, it doesn't work with Firefox, only in Chrome. But I choose not do an entire login management at server. 

I already did it at: [GlDocManager App](https://gldocmanager.herokuapp.com) using PassportJS.

The focus is React, this is my first React App and in the future, I would like do an Admin Dashboard to manage the logs.

To test the app, please folow these steps:

-With mongoDB installed at the machine, start the server:
```shell
cd server
npm run dev
```

-And start the React Appication in client folder:
```shell
cd client
yarn start
```
